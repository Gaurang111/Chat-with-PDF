## Overview

This program is a web application designed to facilitate interaction with the content of PDF files through a question-and-answer format. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. **Upload PDF**: Users can upload PDF files through the web interface.

2. **Text Extraction**: Once a PDF file is uploaded, the program extracts the text content from it using the PyPDF2 library. It breaks down the text into smaller, manageable chunks.

3. **Text Processing**: The extracted text is processed further by splitting it into smaller chunks using a technique called character-based text splitting. This ensures that the text is divided into readable portions.

4. **Understanding Text**: The program utilizes OpenAI's language model to convert the text into embeddings, which are numerical representations of words or phrases. These embeddings help in understanding the semantic meaning of the text.

5. **Building Index**: The program constructs a searchable index of the text chunks using a vector store called FAISS. This index allows for efficient retrieval of relevant text chunks based on user queries.

6. **Question Answering Model**: A pre-trained question-answering model is loaded, which is capable of generating answers based on the context provided to it.

7. **User Interaction**: Users are prompted to input their queries through the web interface.

8. **Search and Answer**: When a user submits a query, the program searches through the indexed text chunks to find relevant information. It then passes these chunks to the question-answering model, which generates answers to the user's query based on the content of the PDF files.

9. **Response**: The answers generated by the model are displayed back to the user through the web interface.

10. **Error Handling**: The program includes mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user in case of any issues encountered during processing.
